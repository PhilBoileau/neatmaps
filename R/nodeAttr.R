#' A dataset containing randomly generated node attributes
#' for each node in each of the ten networks. Attributes A
#' and B have a correlation of roughly 0.8, A and C have a
#' correlation of roughly -0.2, B and C have a correlation
#' of roughly 0.5. Attributes D and E were generated
#' completely randomly, and should not be strongly correlated
