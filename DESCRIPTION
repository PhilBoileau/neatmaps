Description: The goal of the neatmaps package is to simplify the exploratory data analysis process for
             multiple network data sets with the help of hierarchical clustering and heatmaps. This package
             offers the tools necessary to convert the raw data of multiple networks into a single dynamic
             report that summarizes many of the relationships of their graph, node and structural
             characteristics.
