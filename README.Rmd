[![](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/neatmaps)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neatmaps) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/neatmaps)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=neatmaps)

### Overview

The goal of the neatmaps package is to simplify the exploratory data analysis
process for multiple network data sets with the help of heatmaps and consensus
clustering. Multiple network data consists of multiple disjoint networks that
share common variables. Ego network data sets are an example of such data sets.
This package contains the necessary tools to prepare raw multiple network data
for analysis, create a heatmap of the data, perform consensus clustering on the
networks' variables and assess the stability of the variable clusters depicted
in the heatmap.

### Installation

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
# To install neatmaps, simply run the following code:
install.packages('neatmaps')
```

### Code Example

Below is an example of how to use the key functions in the `neatmaps` package.
Run this code locally to produce the plots.

First, load the package, create a data frame with the data provided in the
package and then run the `neatmap` function.
```{r run-neatmap}
library(neatmaps)

df <- netsDataFrame(network_attr_df,
                    node_attr_df,
                    edge_df)

neat_res <- neatmap(df, scale_df = "ecdf", max_k = 3, reps = 100, 
                    xlab = "vars", ylab = "nets", xlab_cex = 1, ylab_cex = 1)
```

Next, plot the heatmap stored in `neat_res`.
```{r plot-heatmap}
neat_res[[1]]
```

Finally, the results of the consensus clustering are visualized to identify the
stable clusters of variables in the heatmap. The consensus matrices are
presented first, followed by the ECDFs of the consensus matrices and finally
the relative change in ECDF of consecutive iterations of the consensus
clustering algorithm.

```{r consensus-matrices}
consensusMap(neat_res)
```

```{r ECDFs}
consensusECDF(neat_res)
```

```{r relative-change-ECDFs}
consensusChangeECDF(neat_res)
```
