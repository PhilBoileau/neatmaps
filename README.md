# Neatmaps

The goal of the neatmaps package is to simplify the exploratory data analysis process for multiple network data sets with the help of hierarchical clustering and heatmaps. This package offers the tools necessary to convert the raw data of multiple networks into a single dynamic report that summarizes many of the relationships of their graph, node and structural characteristics.
